# Multichain

When we refer to the term multichain we are saying that we support multiple
chains in cross transfers and nfts.

While we support multiple blockchains to do different actions we are based on
Solana blockchain for our products, for example, our savings account is based on
Solana blockchain but users can seamessly convert their funds from other
supported blockchains to solana without involving more steps, all of this thanks
to our integration with [wormhole](https://wormhole.com/).

# What blockchains are supported?

At the moment, Sui and Aptos are supported by Ned Wallet, as soon as we
integrate more chains we will update our documentation.
