# Introduction

Ned Finance payments platform enables merchants all over the world to receive
payments in their stores, physicals or digital.

While preserving full autonomy and auto-custody Ned Finance can create a safe
bridge for non blockchain bussinesses to accept payments in crypto currencies.

Our model is based on the stablecoins provided by the company
[Circle](https://www.circle.com/), the company behind USDC and Euro Coin.
