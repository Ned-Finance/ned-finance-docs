# Transfers

Ned allows you to transfer any token to any wallet but in a different way. we
have evaluated the steps needed to send a token in a regular wallet and without
adding more steps to the process we have created a better way to do it, giving
you the option to chat with the counterpart, leaving a record in the chat of
every transaction made between the two parties.
